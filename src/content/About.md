## Howdy! It's nice to meet you.

I'm currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft, working on [Azure Playfab Party SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/playfab/features/multiplayer/networking/party-sdks) and Services for Xbox, as a part of [Azure Gaming Services](https://playfab.com/). Previously in Xbox, I used to work on [Xbox Authentication SDKs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/xbox-live/) for all non-console platforms, i.e. Xbox for PC, iOS, Android, etc.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I interned at [KUNGFU.AI](https://www.kungfu.ai/) in Austin, TX; [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) in Westlake, TX; and [Riot Games](https://www.riotgames.com/) in Santa Monica, CA. You can read about my experience at Riot Games in an article I helped write on the [Riot Games Tech Blog](https://technology.riotgames.com/news/technology-interns-riot-games).

I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, with a focus in Software Engineering, Systems Engineering, and Engineering Management.

While at UT, I was heavily involved with the [Texas Rocket Engineering Lab](https://www.texasrocketlab.com/) (TREL). TREL is a research focused, rocketry start-up based in Austin, Texas; with the primary goal of getting a liquid, bipropellant rocket to the edge of space. As the founding member of the Avionics Software, Hardware, Guidance, Control, and Navigation team (AvGNC), I grew my team from 4 engineers to over 50 in a span of 1.5 years. Our team was responsible for developing, designing, and testing all the flight software, electronics, and control algorithms for the rocket, Halcyon.

In my spare time, I enjoy drinking tea, playing chess, hiking mountains, and eating too much Tex-Mex. At any given time you can find me at my desk, either playing video games or building them.
